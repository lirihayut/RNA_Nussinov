# RNA_Nussinov
A Python implementation of the Nussinov–Jacobson dynamic programming algorithm for RNA folding prediction. The program predicts secondary structures in dot-bracket notation, identifies maximum base pairings (including G–U wobble pairs), and allows manual comparison to mfold or experimental (NMR) results.
